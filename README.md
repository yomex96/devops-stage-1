# Task: Messaging System with RabbitMQ/Celery and Python Application behind Nginx

# Objective: Deploy a Python application behind Nginx that interacts with RabbitMQ/Celery for email sending and logging functionality.

# Requirements:
1. Local Setup:
    - Install RabbitMQ and Celery on your local machine.
- Set up a Python application with the following functionalities:
    - An endpoint that can accept two parameters: ?sendmail and ?talktome.
2. Endpoint Functionalities:
- ?sendmail: When this parameter is passed, the system should:
        - Send an email using SMTP to the value provided (e.g., ?sendmail=mailto:destiny@destinedcodes.com).
        - Use RabbitMQ/Celery to queue the email sending task.
    - Ensure the email-sending script retrieves and executes tasks from the queue.
- ?talktome: When this parameter is passed, the system should:
    - Log the current time to /var/log/messaging_system.log.
3. Nginx Configuration:
    - Configure Nginx to serve your Python application.
    - Ensure proper routing of requests to the application.
4. Endpoint Access:
    - Use ngrok or a similar tool to expose your local application endpoint for external access.
    - Provide a stable endpoint for testing purposes.
5. Documentation and Walk-through:
    - Record a screen-captured walk-through of the entire setup and deployment process.
#  -Ensure the video covers:
        - RabbitMQ/Celery setup.
        - Python application development.
        - Nginx configuration.
        - Sending email via SMTP.
        - Logging current time.
    - Exposing the endpoint using ngrok.
    - Submit the endpoint and screen recording.
